This implements version 1.1 of http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt,
with a keyboard input buffer at 9000-900f and a 40x25 screen buffer at 8000-83f7.

To build:

    ghc --make dcm

To run:

    ./dcm [-r] [-l] [image file]

The -r flag turns on the register display.  The image file is loaded into memory and run.
If the -l flag is given, the image file is read as little endian, otherwise it is read as
big endian.  If no image file is given, a simple default image is used.
