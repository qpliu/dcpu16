This implements version 1.1 of http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt
with a keyboard input buffer at 9000-900f and a screen buffer
starting at 8000.

To build:

    ghc --make dcm

To run:

    ./dcm [-le] [-be] [-WIDTHxHEIGHT] [IMAGE FILE]

The -le flag specifies a little endian image file.  The -be flag
specifies a big endian image file.  The WIDTH and HEIGHT the size
of the display, which defaults to 40x25.  IMAGE FILE is loaded
into memory and run.  If IMAGE FILE is not given, a simple default
image is used.

    C-x C-c    exit
    C-x c      clear dumps
    C-x r      dump registers
    C-x m      dump memory
    C-x C-b    scroll memory dump
    C-x C-f    scroll memory dump
    C-x C-n    scroll memory dump
    C-x C-p    scroll memory dump
    C-x b      scroll memory dump
    C-x f      scroll memory dump
    C-x n      scroll memory dump
    C-x p      scroll memory dump
    C-x B      scroll memory dump
    C-x F      scroll memory dump
